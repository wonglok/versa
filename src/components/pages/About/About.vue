        Dear Readers,
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is a relationship. - Bryant McGill
        <br />
        When we can tag words with relationship, a simple sentence can become a software program.
        <br />

        A sentence has the PURITY of essence and form.
        <br />

        Sentence Pattern is the form of an existence.
        <br />
        Sentence Keywords are the essence of an existence.
        <br />

        We can define a javascript function for a sentence pattern.
        <br />
        We can obtain data from sentence keywords.
        <br />
        That’s it!

        <br />
        <br />
        Appreciate simple things.
        <br />
        It’s the secret of happiness.
        <br />
        <br />

        best wishes,
        <br />
        loklok
